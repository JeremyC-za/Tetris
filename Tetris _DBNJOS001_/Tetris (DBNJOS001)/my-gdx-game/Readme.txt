To get game running:
-Install gradle plugins into eclipse (http://dist.springsource.com/release/TOOLS/gradle)
-Import project into eclipse via gradle.
-Run my-gdx-game-desktop as a java application

-Copy files in workspace into the local eclipse's workspace (usually under Local C -> Users -> 'Username') . (Configs, plugins (metadata) and tetris project folder). 

*Make sure there is sound on the running pc for game music and rotate and place block sounds. 

If you want to have a highscore: create a text document in /my-gdx-game/desktop/Highscore.txt   <---
Simply put a '0' into it and save it.
Otherwise the game will just say "No Highscore"



Controls:
-Up arrow key to rotate the block (press and release so you cant hold it in)
-Down arrow key to increase the speed of the block (You can hold this in)
-Left arrow key to move left (press and release so you cant hold it in)
-Right arrow key to move right (press and release so you cant hold it in)
-Space key to instant drop
-V key to use special ability (explained below)
-R key to restart the game.


Features: 
-Press the 'v' key to use the special ability (when it is ready), which you can only use every 30 seconds, twise in a row at the start of every new level.
It will slow the block down to a stop for 5 seconds, where you can still move left and right, use the down arrow key to move the block and rotate the block.
-Press the 'r' key to restart the game.

Indicator on the Right Side of Tetris:

How to Play:
-Block will fall and you rotate the and fit them in with other blocks to try and form complete rows.
-When a row completes it will clear it and move all the other blocks down.
-If your blocks reach the top of the screen the game ends.
-The higher level you get the more score you will get (Score multiplyer)
-As you get score you will begin to increase in levels. 
-As you increase in levels the blocks will start to fall faster. 

Finish the game to save your highscore (closing before losing the game wont save!)
